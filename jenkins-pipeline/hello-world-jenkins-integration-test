How to integrate github with localhost jenkins

Tools to use: - socketxp/ngrok

1) download socketxp client in linux machine

$socketxp relay http://192.168.0.110:8080/github-webhook/
- 192.168.0.110:8080 is jenkins localhost ip address


2) configure github

	- configured public domain address from socketxp serviuces  
	- for examples: https://webhook.socketxp.com/bobo-team9495-github-com-39223

Everything is set! jenkins will trigger the jobs automatically!
